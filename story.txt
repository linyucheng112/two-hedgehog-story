Two hedgehogs:

Once upon a time, tow hedgehogs fell in love. However, there was a problem. They often got hurt when they were hug. They decided to go to a salon designed for hedgehogs.

When the hedgehogs got to the salon, they looked at all of the services offered there for hedgehogs. They found out that they were able to get their spikes trimmed. The hedgehogs decided that it was the best idea for them to trim their spikes so that they could hug.

After thier visit to the salon the hedgehogs were so happy that they could finally be together without hurting one another. They were inseparable. At the movies they could sit close together, in the park they could walk side-by-side, and do other hedgehog things, but now together!

Soon the winter came and the weather grew cold. The hedgehogs realized that they needed their spikes so they grew them out. The hedgehogs missed each other dearly, but soon realized they could buy a jacket designed specifically for hedgehogs. They again trimmed their spikes, and they again were happy.

Though these two hedgehogs faced so many difficulties, they were still in love in every single day. Love cannot be defeated by anything, no matter whether the difficulties are from inside or outside.
