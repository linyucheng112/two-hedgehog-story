Two hedgehogs:

Once upon a time, tow hedgehogs fell in love. However, there was a problem. They often got hurt when they were hug. They decided to go to a salon designed for hedgehogs.

When the hedgehogs got to the salon, they looked at all of the services offered there for hedgehogs. They found out that they were able to get their spikes trimmed. The hedgehogs decided that it was the best idea for them to trim their spikes so that they could hug.
